        </header>

        <article>
            <p>Injustice surrounds us.</p>

            <p>In China, the Uyghur population are forced to live in camps where their human rights are systematically violated. In Sudan, the ongoing conflict has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced Darfuri at the hands of Sudanese paramilitary groups in what many call an ethnic cleansing. In Eastern Europe, Ukrainians are protecting their homeland against a far more powerful army. And these are just a few.</p>

            <p>I provide these examples—just a few of many—to demonstrate what people usually think of when they hear of injustice. Its definition is "the lack of fairness" or more literally, the lack of justice. But the common thread through the above examples is oppressive external factors that create unjust environments for individuals and communities.</p>

            <p>Another type of injustice exists, though—one that I think is oft overlooked, one that is internally driven, and one that puts the burden of achieving justice on the individual.</p>

            <p>It comes from Plato.</p>

            <p>Among his many groundbreaking and influential theories, Plato believed in something called the "tripartite soul." This tripartite soul was exactly what it sounds like—the theory that every human has three parts to his or her soul: the <em>logos</em>, the <em>thymos</em>, and the <em>eros</em>. The logos, according to Plato, deals with reason or logic. The thymos relates to spirit. And the eros is the emotion.</p>

            <p>For Plato, when all three parts are executing their jobs correctly, the logos controls the thymos and the eros. In other words, the logical part of the soul keeps the emotional and the spirited parts in check. To be clear, this does not mean that logic suppresses emotion and spirit. Rather, this internal state of justice means that logic ensures emotion and spirit are held in the correct disposition. However, if the thymos and eros are able to ignore or use the logos for their own pleasure, then the individual enters a state of injustice.</p>

            <p>Let's, for the sake of argument, assume Plato is correct in this metaphysical analysis of the human soul.</p>

            <p>If we look around us today, everyone seems to be angry about something. In politics, specifically, outrage has become a currency with which individuals buy sympathy, support, and votes. Quite frankly, most existing discourse on important problems has become purely emotional.</p>

            <p>I argue, unoriginally, that a great deal of injustice exists today. Yes, injustice in its traditional form—one that exhibits itself in the examples I give above.</p>

            <p>But injustice exists within the individual. Far too many people have allowed the spirited and emotional parts of their respective souls to hold hostage the rational, logic-driven part.</p>

            <p>And to give us, collectively, a better chance at solving macro-scale injustices all around the world, individuals must first restore justice within—by recalibrating the tripartite soul to a state that Plato called "temperance"—where logic controls spirit and emotion.</p>

            <p>The following are just a few examples of how the loss of individual justice—by way of the uncalibrated soul—has seemingly rendered pressing issues unsolvable.</p>

            <p>For the past few months, the southern border has become a serious issue in American politics. The situation is untenable as thousands of migrants are attempting to enter the United States each day—and the current infrastructure is not set up to legally and safely process everyone. As a result, members of Congress have been negotiating a bill that would address the issue. However, former—and possibly future—President Donald Trump, arguably the most unjust individual of them all, has been speaking out against the bill. He believes that if the serious problem is left untouched, it gives him a ripe issue on which to run his Presidential campaign.</p>

            <p>This stance puts current Republican lawmakers in a bind. Should they do the logical thing and pass a bill that would have real benefit? Or should they succumb to their personal desires to appease a powerful figure in their party by turning their backs on the issue? So far, they have opted for the latter.</p>

            <p>I argue, as altruistic and unrealistic as it may be, that if these legislators existed in a state of calibration, the decision would be clear. There would be no question that the morally, logically right thing to do would be to pass the bill. No matter how much their appetite would argue for the appeasement of the almighty Trump for their own personal future, the logic would override.</p>

            <p>I want to be clear that emotion and spirit are necessities for the human experience. They allow us to build meaningful relationships, live life to its fullest, and in some cases, they help inform logical decisions. But in today's world, one that's driven by technology mostly designed to enrage, it is imperative that individuals keep logic in the driver's seat—no matter what setting you find yourself in.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, outrage is everywhere. Sometimes it's deserved and necessary, but I argue that it can't and shouldn't become the default disposition for individuals in our society. To create lasting positive change and end large-scale injustices, individuals must focus on calibrating themselves—and existing in a state where logic keeps spirit and emotion in check, not the inverse.</p>
